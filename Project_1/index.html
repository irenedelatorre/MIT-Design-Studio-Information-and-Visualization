        <p>The inspiration for this time visualization was the concept of nesting. One of the properties I uncovered through my ideation was that there was natural nesting between the various time measurement units: within a day there are 24 hours, within an hour there are 60 minutes, and within a minute there are 60 seconds.</p>
        <p>With this visualization I sought to represent this notion visually through the encapsulation of smaller spheres by larger spheres, representing the relationship between the larger units.</p>
        <p>If you analyze my still visualization above, you will see that within each purple cirlce, representing a single hour in a day, there are 60 smaller orange circles encapsulated within it, representing a single minute in an hour.</p>

        <div id="plot2"></div>
        <p>The inspiration for this time visualization was periodicity and distance. My goal for was to emphasize the period nature of time on a clock, drawing attention to it's cyclical nature, which is best described through circles, a primitive shape with no beginning and no end, much like time.</p>
        <p>The red arc represents the seconds, the orange arc represents minutes, and the yellow arc represents hours. Due to the continuous/analog nature of the arcs, I added a digital clock in the center of the arcs to not only aid in the funtional process of determining time, but to also serve as a fucntional juxtaposition to the aesthetic arcs.</p>

        <h2 class="col-md-12">Sketch 3</h2>
        <div id="plot3"></div>
        <p>The inspiration for this time visualization was the concept of space and growth. My goals for this visualization was to communication the passage of time by exploiting two-dimensional space as a measure of the amount of elapsed time in a day.</p>
        <p>I decided to have some fun by grounding the visualization in a metaphor of building a structure through time. Each light green block represents a minute. It takes 60 seconds for a block to fall from the sky and rest on the surface of the structure build over the course of the day. At each hour interval, a larger dark green slab covers the 60 minute blocks that have fallen to rest, representing the end of an hour.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, the tower resulting from the elapsed time is erased, marking the end of one day and the beginning of a new one.</p>
