                I wanted to have a bright and playful Interface so I chose a warm yellow and a font i found online called Prism. The line to the right of the screen represents the highs and lows of the day and the orange circle represents the current temperature while the blue dot represents the real feel temperature at the same time. The graph below it is showing the temperature vs. time of both the normal temperature and the real feel temperature. I wanted to use this graph to show the wide didcrepancy in boston between the 'temperature' and the real feel temperature usually caused because of wind. At the bottom I am also displaying a pie chart of humidity and cloud coverage which both range from 0->1 so I thought representing them as half of a whole would world for the data range. To the right of that is the wind speed and the percent chance for precipitation.

                For the abstract drawing I wanted to visualize the moon and the sun. Since the darkSky data gives up the exact moon phase, the shape of the moon would correspond to that figure while the times next to the moond represent sundown and the time next to the sun represents sun rise. Further, the number of 'rays' coming out of the sun correspond to the 10's digit of the temperature while the number of stars on the moon's side correspond to the 1's digit of the temperature.
